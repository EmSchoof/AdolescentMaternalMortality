Capstone Milestone Report: Maternal Mortality in Mexico

The primary purpose of this study was to assess the rates of adolescent maternal mortality within Mexico, and calculate the risk probability of an adolescent maternal mortality by region in Mexico based on some of the top features contributing to maternal mortality. While this is a multi-dimensional issue, for the sake of this study, the following 8 factors will be used to predict the likelihood of adolescent maternal mortality by region: region population, region GDP, local poverty level, level of education, and access to medical assistance in order to help direct government funds to areas where it would be most beneficial. 

On the World Health Bank website, girls’ education has been identified as one of the most effective development priorities. Better educated women tend to be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, have fewer children, marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children, should they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and nations out of poverty. Roughly 13 million adolescent girls (under 20) give birth every year, and complications from those pregnancies and childbirth are a leading cause of death for those young mothers (many suffer the consequences of unsafe abortion). Therefore, it would be most efficient to assess which factors lead to the lowest levels of adolescent maternal mortality. Additionally, while this is a global issue, this study will specifically focus on Mexico.

The incidences of maternal mortality are recorded by Mexico’s Ministry of Health in a robust SALUD data repository. Initially cleaned by the Data Science for Social Good organization, this public information contains on all recorded cases of maternal mortality in Mexico between 2002 through 2017. Additionally, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population of each Mexican Region for 2010 and 2015 were obtained from OECD’s statistics online database.
