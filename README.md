Capstone Report: Maternal Mortality in Mexico

The primary purpose of this study was to assess the rates of maternal mortality within Mexico, and how to reduce its instance long term. In 1990, the United Nations stated that 1 of its 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was to reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters worldwide. Unquestionably, the incidence of maternal mortality has decreased since the UN initiative in 2015. Many women have benefited from substantial improvements in care during pregnancy and childbirth and advances in prenatal and postnatal health care; however, despite major successes, maternal mortality still remains a major medical problem worldwide. 

Roughly 13 million adolescent girls (under 20) give birth every year, and complications from those pregnancies and childbirth are a leading cause of death for those young mothers (many suffer the consequences of unsafe abortion). Therefore, it would be most efficient to assess which factors lead to the lowest levels of adolescent maternal mortality.

Machine learning methods are becoming increasingly relevant as data becomes more readily available. These methods enable researchers to expand on their general understanding of the complex dynamic changes in indicators with a significant number of interrelated factors. Additionally, it is possible to make the results, like external factors affecting the incidence of adolescent maternal mortality, interpretable from a clinical point of view.
